Summary of What You've Accomplished:
Django API Endpoints: You created and exposed two API endpoints in Django:

/api/hello/ that returns a "Hello from Django!" message.
/api/datetime/ that returns the current date and time.
React Frontend: You developed a React component that:

Fetches data from the Django API endpoints.
Displays the fetched data (message and current datetime) on the web page.
CORS Configuration: You correctly configured CORS in Django to allow your React app to communicate with the Django backend.
